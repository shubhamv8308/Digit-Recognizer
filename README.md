# Digit-Recognizer

Project Title: Digit Recognizer Using Deep Learning

Project Description:

This project aims to develop a digit recognition system utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), combined with Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization through grid search. The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, leveraging CNN's capability for image recognition and Keras Tuner's grid search to fine-tune the model's performance.

Key steps in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Preparing the MNIST dataset by normalizing pixel values and applying data augmentation techniques such as random flips and rotations to enhance the model's robustness and generalization ability.

Model Building: Constructing a CNN architecture using a dynamic approach where the number of convolutional layers and filters, kernel size, padding, and activation functions are all hyperparameters that Keras Tuner optimizes. The model includes several convolutional and pooling layers, optional dropout for regularization, and a final dense layer with a softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search: Implementing Keras Tuner's Grid Search strategy to explore fixed and variable hyperparameters. The code includes fixed parameters for a specific architecture and tunes new entries by adjusting the number of layers, filter sizes, pooling options, dropout, and activation functions to identify the optimal configuration.

Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the training dataset with early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to prevent overfitting and improve convergence. It is evaluated on the validation dataset to ensure high accuracy and performance.

Optimization and Performance: The training process leverages hyperparameter tuning to explore a wide range of configurations, using categorical crossentropy as the loss function and accuracy as the primary metric. The optimized model aims to achieve high recognition rates, suitable for applications in digitizing handwritten content and automating numerical data entry.

This project demonstrates the integration of deep learning with Keras Tuner's grid search to achieve a highly optimized digit recognition system, showcasing how hyperparameter tuning can significantly enhance model performance.
